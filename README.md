# GymTime PWA
GymTime is a web app that allows the user to choose between different workouts depending on his goals/preferences. The user will also be able to create his own custom Workout by adding exercises from the database as well as leave a rating/comment for premade workouts.

## Technologies
The application will be built using the following technologies:
- Next.js
- PostgreSQL
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)
- Integration testing with Cypress

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
